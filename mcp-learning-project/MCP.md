## What is a MCP
MCP is often described as the “USB-C for AI applications.” Just as USB-C provides a standardized physical and logical interface for connecting various peripherals to computing devices, MCP offers a consistent protocol for linking AI models to external capabilities. This standardization benefits the entire ecosystem:

- users enjoy simpler and more consistent experiences across AI applications
- AI application developers gain easy integration with a growing ecosystem of tools and data sources
- tool and data providers need only create a single implementation that works with multiple AI applications
- the broader ecosystem benefits from increased interoperability, innovation, and reduced fragmentation
